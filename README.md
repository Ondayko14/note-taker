# Note-Taker
Node/Express/Javascript/

## How it works
Start the application by clicking on the link below! Then click note and start typing away! The notes will save themselves on the left side. Save with the save icon that will appear as you type at the top right. For a new note, please select the pencil icon. To view an older note, simply click on the notes on the left!

### Lessons Along The Way
This was my first fullstack project. I had troubles getting the req.body to read. It was until several hours in and some help that I relized the need to install body-parser! The application build went quite smoothly before and after that tho, so overall, not too bad!
